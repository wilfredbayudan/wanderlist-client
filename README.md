# Wanderlist App

Wanderlist is a web-based app that encourages travelers to share ideas on destinations they should add to their next trip. Users may view bucketlists, interact with them through likes and comments, or share their own.

## Usage

### Routes
* `/` - **Homepage**

The homepage renders a collection of markers on a map generated by MapBox. Each marker represents a destination that has been added to a bucketlist. Clicking on a marker will reveal a popup with additional details for the destination, as well as the ability to 'like' it.

* `/bucketlists` - **Bucketlists**

The Bucketlists page retrieves a list of all created bucketlists. When a user hovers over a bucketlist, markers are rendered on the map to preview the destinations that are included in that bucketlist. Clicking on a bucketlist will navigate the user to the details page for that specific bucketlist. ('/bucketlists/:id')

* `/bucketlists/:id` - **Bucketlist Details**

The Bucketlists Details page will fetch additional data about a specific bucketlist. The user may like/dislike the bucketlist, post comments, and view any notes that the author included with their destinations. If the correct PIN is passed as a parameter in the URL (ie. '/bucketlists/1?pin=1234'), the user will be able to manage the bucketlist (Edit description, add/delete/edit destinations, delete entire list).

* `/bucketlists/new` - **New Bucketlist**
* `/destinations` - **Destinations**
